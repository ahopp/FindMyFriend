# FindMyFriend
Find My Friend game of finding your friend via random walk.

My friend asked about how long it may take for two friends in
a room to find each other if they are performing a random walk.
This is a quick hour or so implementation.  I will be changing some
of the mechanics around in the future.  For example, I will
implement a gridless approach with bounding circles and strategic
movements.

For now, enjoy the base implementation.
